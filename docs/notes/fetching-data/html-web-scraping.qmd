# Fetching HTML Data

If the data you want to fetch is in XML or HTML format, we can use the `requests` package to fetch it, and the `beautifulsoup4` package to process it.

```{python}
import requests

# the URL of some CSV data we stored online:
request_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prof-rossetti/python-for-finance/main/docs/data/gradebook.xml"

response = requests.get(request_url)
print(type(response))
```

Pass the response text to the `BeautifulSoup` class constructor.

```{python}
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text)
type(soup)
```

The soup object is able to intelligently process the data.



```{python}
students = soup.find_all("student")
print(type(students))
len(students)
```


```{python}
for student in students:
    print("-----------")
    print(type(student))
    student_id = student.studentid.text
    final_grade = student.finalgrade.text
    print(student_id, final_grade)
```
