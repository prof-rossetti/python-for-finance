# Control Flow

Control flow...

Not all code is executed. Sometimes code is only reached under certain conditions. Some code may never be reached or executed.

Indentation controls the scope.

The simplest way to study control flow is the if statement and [conditional logic](conditional-logic.qmd).

One of the most important parts of programming is defining your own [custom functions](custom-functions.qmd).

[Error handling](errors.qmd) is another common example of control flow in action.
