# Python Language Overview


Example Code:

```{python}
# this is a comment

print("HELLO WORLD") # another comment

x = 5
print(x)
```

Let's debrief this one concept at a time.


## Comments


## Built In Functions

### The `print` Function

### The `input` Function


## Variables

```{python}
x = 5
print(x)
```

Inherent in the name "variable" is that the value can change over time:

```{python}
x = 5
print(x)

x = 10
print(x)

x = x + 10
print(x)

x += 10
print(x)
```
