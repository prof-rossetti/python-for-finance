# Numbers


You are already probably familiar with [numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#numeric-types-int-float-complex).


## Characteristics

In Python, there are two kinds of numbers: integers and floats. Integers are whole numbers without a decimal component, while floats have decimal component:


```{python}
x = 2
print(type(x))
print(x)
```

```{python}
x = 2.0
print(type(x))
print(x)
```


## Operations

### Arithmetic Operations

It is no surprise, we can use Python as a glorified calculator, to perform arithmetic operations:


```{python}
print(2 + 10)
print(2 - 10)
print(2 * 10)
print(2 / 10)
```

### Rounding

It is possible to round numbers using the [`round` function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round):

```{python}
print(round(6.675555, 0))
print(round(6.675555, 1))
print(round(6.675555, 2))
print(round(6.675555, 3))
print(round(6.675555, 4))
print(round(6.675555, 5))
```
