# Processing Tabular Data with `pandas`

**Pandas Package Overview for Data Science (Mega Notebook)**

The [`pandas` package](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) makes it easy to work with CSV formatted (i.e. \"tabular\") data, by providing us with two new datatypes, called the `DataFrame` and the `Series`.
