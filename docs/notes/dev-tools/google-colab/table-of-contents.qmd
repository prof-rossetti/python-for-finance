# Table of Contents

The "Table of contents" menu in the Google Colab sidebar shows a document outline, similar to a table of contents you may be familiar with in word processing software.

The heading structure of your markdown cells will govern the document structure displayed in the table of contents. It is helpful to practice your ability to implement a document outline by implementing different [Markdown heading levels](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#headings) in your text cells.

NOTE: you may need to place each of the headings in their own text cells for the document oultine to collapse properly.
