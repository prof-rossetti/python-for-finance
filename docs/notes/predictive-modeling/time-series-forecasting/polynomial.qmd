# Regression with Polynomial Features for Time Series Forecasting



## Linear Regression




Results and Interpretation:

Train R-squared: 0.85

This indicates that the linear regression model explains about 85% of the variance in the GDP data during the training period. It suggests that the model fits the training data reasonably well.

A negative R-squared score on the test set means that the model performs poorly on future data, doing worse than a simple horizontal line (mean prediction). This is a clear indication that the linear regression model is not capturing the temporal patterns in the GDP data and fails to generalize beyond the training period.
