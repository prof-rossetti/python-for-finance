# Predictive Modeling Process

Define the Problem:

  + What is the target output variable (`y`) we want to predict? Do we have the ground truth labels or not?
  + What are the input features (`x`) we can use to make the prediction?
  + What kind of model(s) should we use to do the predicting?
  + What scoring metrics should we use?

Prepare the Data:

  + Checking for Nulls
  + Checking for Outliers
  + Examining Relationships
  + Data Scaling
  + Data Encoding
  + Data Splitting


Train and Evaluate the Model(s):

  + Choose an appropriate model.
  + Train the model on the training dataset (x and y), so it knows the "right answers".
  + Evaluate the model on the testing dataset, which contains data it hasn't yet "seen"

Prediction and Forecasting:
  + Use the model to make predictions on real
