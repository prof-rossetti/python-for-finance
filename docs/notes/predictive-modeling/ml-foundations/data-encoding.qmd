# Data Encoding


When preparing features (`x` values) for training machine learning models, the models need the data to be in numeric format, in order to perform math with the values.

So if we have categorical or textual data, we will need to use a **data encoding** strategy to represent the data in a different way.


use either an ordinal or one-hot encoding strategy, depending on whether there is a certain ordered relationship.


## Ordinal Encoding

If the data has an order about it, where one category means more or less than others, then we will convert the categories into a linear range of numbered values.


## Time Step Encoding

When dealing with time series data, we need to convert the dates to numbers. We can create an ordered list of time step integers, where 1 represents the first time point, 2 represents the second time point, etc.




## One-hot Encoding


If the data is truly categorical, where there is no ordinal relationship present, we will perform "one-hot" encoding.
