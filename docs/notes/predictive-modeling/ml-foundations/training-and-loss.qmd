# Model Training and Evaluation

maximizing some objective, and measuring it.

Some models are "closed-form" models, which use a predetermined function to arrive at the ideal weights. The Linear Regression is one example of this.

Other models use an "iterative optimization" technique to arrive at the ideal weights over a number of simulated trial periods, or "epochs". Deep learning models rely on this iterative optimization approach.
