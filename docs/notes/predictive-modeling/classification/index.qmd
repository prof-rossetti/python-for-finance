# Classification

**Classification** is a supervised learning task where the variable we are trying to predict is discrete, whether that is binary or categorical.

Some examples of discrete data include:

  + Whether an email is spam or not (binary)
  + Whether an outcome is successful or not (binary)
  + Which of nine numeric digits is represented by some handwriting (categorical)
  + Which of three families a given penguin is likely to be a member of (categorical)

In this chapter, we will explore different classification models, and introduce key performance metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of classification models.



## Classification Objectives



## Classification Models

Classification Models:

  + Logistic Regression (yes, this is a classification, not a regression model)
  + Decision Tree
  + Random Forest
  + etc.

## Classification Metrics

Classification Metrics:

  + Accuracy
  + Precision
  + Recall
  + F-1 Score
  + ROC AUC
  + etc.
