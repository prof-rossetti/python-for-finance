# Charts with Trendlines





Consider the previous scatter plot example:



```{python}
scatter_data = [
    {"income": 30_000, "life_expectancy": 65.5},
    {"income": 30_000, "life_expectancy": 62.1},
    {"income": 50_000, "life_expectancy": 66.7},
    {"income": 50_000, "life_expectancy": 71.0},
    {"income": 70_000, "life_expectancy": 72.5},
    {"income": 70_000, "life_expectancy": 77.3},
    {"income": 90_000, "life_expectancy": 82.9},
    {"income": 90_000, "life_expectancy": 80.0},
]

incomes = []
expectancies = []
for item in scatter_data:
    incomes.append(item["income"])
    expectancies.append(item["life_expectancy"])

print(incomes)
print(expectancies)
```

```{python}
from plotly.express import scatter

fig = scatter(x=incomes, y=expectancies, height=350,
          title="Life Expectancy by Income",
          labels={"x": "Income", "y": "Life Expectancy (years)"},
)
fig.show()
```

Upon viewing the chart, looks like there may be evidence of a trend.

The [`scatter` function](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.express.scatter) has some trend-line related parameters:

```{python}
from plotly.express import scatter

fig = scatter(x=incomes, y=expectancies, height=350,
          title="Life Expectancy by Income",
          labels={"x": "Income", "y": "Life Expectancy (years)"},
          trendline="ols", trendline_color_override="red"
)
fig.show()
```

:::{.callout-note title="FYI"}
Under the hood, `plotly` uses the `statsmodels` package to calculate the trend, so you may have to install that package as well.
:::

In addition to \"ols\" trend, which is an Ordinary Least Squares linear trend, we can use a \"lowess\" trend which is a [non-parametric method](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonparametric-statistics.asp) that can be a better fit for non-linear relationships:

```{python}
from plotly.express import scatter

fig = scatter(x=incomes, y=expectancies, height=350,
          title="Life Expectancy by Income",
          labels={"x": "Income", "y": "Life Expectancy (years)"},
          trendline="lowess", trendline_color_override="red"
)
fig.show()
```

If you notice, for the lowess trend, there is a slight bend in the curve.
