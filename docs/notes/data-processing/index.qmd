# Data Processing in Python

Let's work with lists in much more detail, as we study list-based data processing techniques:

   + [List Sorting](./sorting.qmd)
   + [List Iteration and Looping](./for-loops.qmd)
   + [List Mapping](./mapping.qmd)
   + [List Filtering](./filtering.qmd)
   + [List Comprehensions](./list-comprehensions.qmd)
