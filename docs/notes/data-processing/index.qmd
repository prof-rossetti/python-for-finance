# Data Processing in Python

Let's get more practice working with nested structures and the `list` datatype, employing techniques such as the following:

  + [Sorting Lists](./sorting.qmd)
  + [Mapping Lists](./mapping.qmd)
  + [Filtering Lists](./filtering.qmd)
  + [List Comprehensions](./list-comprehensions.qmd)
